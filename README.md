# How to compile

To compile the paper: 
```{sh}
make paper 
```

The directories **jsq2_simulate** and **simu** contains the files
necessary to generate the figures.
* jsq2_simulate contains:
  * a file "two_choice_simulator.cc" that is a C++ implementation of a simulator of the two-choice model
  * an "ipython"-notebook that is used to generate simulation data and the figures
* simu contains the files to generates the figures of the small 1 dimensional example of Section 4. 

To compile the simulator and re-generate all figures, just type 
```{sh}
make simulator
make simulations
```
Note that the directory `jsq2_simulate/results` and `jsq2_simulate/traj` contain simulation results that are not re-generated each time (in order to save time). Removing these files and launching `make simulations` (or executing directely the "jupyter notebook" `jsq2_simulate/Rate of convergence two choice.ipynb`) will regenerate these files. This might take a while (~10h).
